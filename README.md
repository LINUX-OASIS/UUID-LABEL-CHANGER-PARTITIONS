A powerful and safe TUI (Text-based User Interface) utility for changing the `UUID` and `LABEL` of your Linux partitions. Built with `bash` and `whiptail`, this script provides a user-friendly way to manage partition identifiers without needing to memorize complex command-line arguments.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Interactive TUI**: Easy-to-navigate menus powered by `whiptail`.
*   **üõ°Ô∏è Safe Operations**: Automatically checks for mounted partitions and prompts to unmount them before making changes.
*   **üîç Filesystem Checks**: Performs pre-flight consistency checks (`e2fsck`, `btrfs check`) to ensure data integrity.
*   **üìÇ Broad Filesystem Support**: Works with `ext4`, `btrfs`, and `vfat` (FAT32) partitions.
*   **ü§ñ Automatic Dependency Installation**: Checks for required tools and installs them via `apt` if missing.
*   **üé® Custom UUIDs**:
    *   Generate a fully **random** UUID.
    *   Create a "vanity" UUID with a **repeating character** (e.g., `AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA`).
*   **üè∑Ô∏è Label Management**: Easily change partition labels for better organization.
*   **üîÑ Kernel Update**: Forces the kernel to re-read the partition table after changes using `partprobe`.

## üíª Compatibility

This script is designed for Debian-based Linux distributions that use the `apt` package manager. It is known to be compatible with:

*   Debian
*   Ubuntu (and its flavors like Kubuntu, Xubuntu)
*   Linux Mint
*   ...and other Debian derivatives.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

The script requires several command-line utilities to function. It will automatically check for these and attempt to install any that are missing using `sudo apt install`.

*   `btrfs-progs`
*   `whiptail`
*   `mtools`
*   `uuid-runtime` (for `uuidgen`)
*   `dosfstools` (for `fatlabel`)
*   `e2fsprogs` (for `e2fsck`, `tune2fs` - usually pre-installed)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the script):**

    ```bash
    # Replace with your actual repository URL
    git clone https://github.com/LINUX-OASIS/uuid-label-changer.git
    cd uuid-label-changer
    ```

2.  **Make the script executable:**

    ```bash
    chmod +x custom-UUID-OR-LABEL-CHANGER-PARTITIONS.sh
    ```

3.  **Run the script with `sudo`:**

    The script requires root privileges for installing packages, unmounting partitions, and modifying filesystem metadata.

    ```bash
    sudo ./custom-UUID-OR-LABEL-CHANGER-PARTITIONS.sh
    ```

4.  Follow the on-screen interactive prompts to select your partition and the desired action.
